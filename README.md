# [Build a Survey Form](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)

Part of the [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) curriculum.

## Objective

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP.

## Solution

* Built using HTML, CSS, JS, [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
* Inspired by [this Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3963594-Form-builder-application).
* Custom radio groups and checkboxes are used throughout the application.
* This enabled a deep dive into ARIA accessibility for these elements.
  * [ARIA Radio Group Example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/radio/radio-1/radio-1.html)
  * [ARIA Checkbox Example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/checkbox/checkbox-1/checkbox-1.html)
* Functionality for these items is provided by JavaScript. ES6 classes are used to provide behaviour for all dynamic elements on the page.

## Development tools

* [BrowserSync](https://github.com/Browsersync/browser-sync) is used to provide live reloading during development.
